# Background

For this data science final project, I will analyze the PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) disclosure files provided by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). These disclosure files contain valuable information about foreign labor certification programs in the United States.

### Data Source
- **Data Provider**: U.S. Department of Labor, ETA
- **Dataset Link**: [PERM Program - Fiscal Year 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 Disclosure Files](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance)
- **Data Description**: The dataset consists of disclosure files for the PERM program, a labor certification program for employers seeking to hire foreign workers for permanent employment in the United States.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this data science project is to explore, analyze, and gain insights from the PERM program disclosure data for the fiscal years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. I aim to answer various research questions, uncover trends, and provide valuable information.

## Key Tasks and Analysis Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   - Handling missing data, outliers, and data quality issues.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding the distribution of key variables.
   - Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
   
3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculating summary statistics for relevant features.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Creating informative graphs and charts to visually represent the data.
   - Exploring relationships between variables.
   
5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses and make data-driven inferences.
   
6. **Predictive Modeling** (optional):
   - Building machine learning models if applicable, such as predicting the likelihood of certification approval based on various factors.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
   - Providing recommendations or policy suggestions based on the data.

# Research Questions

1. Trend Analysis:

What is the trend in the number of PERM applications filed over the selected fiscal years?
Can we identify any seasonality or long-term trends in application submissions?

2. Approval Rates Over Time:

How have the approval rates for PERM applications changed from 2019 to 2022?
Are there any noticeable variations in approval rates across different industries or regions?

3. Processing Time Trends:

Is there a trend in the average processing time for PERM applications?
Have processing times improved or worsened over the years?

4. Industry Insights:

Which industries have the highest and lowest certification rates?
Can we visualize the distribution of approved applications across various sectors?

5. Geographical Analysis:

What are the top states with the highest number of PERM applications?
Are there states where the approval rates significantly differ from the national average?

6. Top Occupations:

Which job categories consistently receive the most certifications?
Can we visualize the top occupations that foreign workers are hired for?

7. Wage Distribution:

How does the wage distribution vary across different job categories?
Are there job categories where the offered wages tend to be higher or lower?

8. Country of Origin:

What are the primary countries of origin for foreign workers in PERM applications?
Can we visualize the diversity in the nationalities of foreign workers?

9. Processing Times by Country:

Are there significant differences in processing times for applications from specific countries?
Can we visualize the average processing times by country of the foreign worker?

10. Impact of Visa Preference:

How does the choice of visa preference category affect approval rates?
Are certain preference categories more likely to lead to certification?

11. Changes Over Fiscal Years:

Can we identify any noteworthy changes in the data trends or patterns between 2019 and 2022?
Are there any outliers or anomalies in specific years that require investigation?

12. Correlation Analysis:

Is there a correlation between factors like offered wages and approval rates?
Can we identify any strong relationships between variables using correlation matrices?

13. Visualization of Denials:

Visualize the reasons for application denials or withdrawals, highlighting common issues.
Are there trends in the types of documentation problems leading to denials?

14. Policy Analysis:

Use visualizations to highlight policy changes over the years and their potential impact on certification rates.
Are there notable changes in the data coinciding with specific policy changes?

15. Interactive Dashboards:

Create interactive dashboards to allow users to explore the data, filter by various criteria, and gain insights on-demand.
