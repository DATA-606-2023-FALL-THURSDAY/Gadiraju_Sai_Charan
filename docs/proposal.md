# Background

For this data science final project, I will analyze the PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) disclosure files provided by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). These disclosure files contain valuable information about foreign labor certification programs in the United States.

### Data Source
- **Data Provider**: U.S. Department of Labor, ETA
- **Dataset Link**: [PERM Program - Fiscal Year 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 Disclosure Files](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance)
- **Data Description**: The dataset consists of disclosure files for the PERM program, a labor certification program for employers seeking to hire foreign workers for permanent employment in the United States.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this data science project is to explore, analyze, and gain insights from the PERM program disclosure data for the fiscal years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. I aim to answer various research questions, uncover trends, and provide valuable information.

## Key Tasks and Analysis Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   - Handling missing data, outliers, and data quality issues.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding the distribution of key variables.
   - Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
   
3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculating summary statistics for relevant features.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Creating informative graphs and charts to visually represent the data.
   - Exploring relationships between variables.
   
5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses and make data-driven inferences.
   
6. **Predictive Modeling** (optional):
   - Building machine learning models if applicable, such as predicting the likelihood of certification approval based on various factors.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
   - Providing recommendations or policy suggestions based on the data.
